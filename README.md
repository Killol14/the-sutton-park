# Sutton-Park

## Milestone Project 1: Static Front-End Website 

 

(IMAGES)  

 

Sutton Park, is one of the largest nature reserves in the UK/Europe, located in the West Midlands. The aim of the website is to give potential visitors a glimpse of the beauty of the park, and obtain information about the opening times, restaurants and nature and activities located in the park.  

 

This is my Milestone project 1 submission for Code Institute’s Diploma in Web Application Development course. My Website features six pages and is built using languages that I have learnt including, HTML, CSS, JAVA, and Bootstrap.

## Design 

For the Main title page of The Sutton Park website, (H1) I used Ubuntu as the main font. This is a clear and simplistic font enabling Viewers of the website see clearly the topic of the website.  

The main text in the website is formatted using Montserrat- Bold. Again, this is a visually striking text that is simplistic and enables the reader to navigate the website easily.  

 

## Colour Scheme  

Used RGB throughout.  

I chose this colour scheme, as the website is based around Nature, the Green and beige colour scheme match with the nature tones of the topic of the website.  

 

## Images  

As this website is based on an area of Natural Beauty, I have included images of the park in order to show the diverse aesthetic of the park.  

The front page has carousel images in order to give a snapshot of the park.  

I have also added extra pictures to each subheading on the website to give a visualization of the attractions situated in the park.  

The website contains border radius throughout for the images to make them more striking and visually appealing 

I have also added a link to a gallery section, in order to give the reader more of an idea of the beauty of the park.  

 

## Icons  

I used the social media on the footer Icons, which are located on the footer from, Font Awesome.  

 

## Structure  

 

### Navigation Bar  

The navigation bar is Static and is sticky, so the user can refer back to the links at the top at any point.  

I have added the navigation bar on the gallery page in order to provide the reader with more information, eg Park Map, Events, Contact, without having to press the back key 

### Carousel 

For the carousel image I have used the Bootstrap 4.5 and 7  

### Hyperlinks  

I have included Hyperlinks on the webpage to allow the user to go straight to different websites where external companies provide more details about the events/restaurants/Opening times to get more information.  

### Map  

I have included a Map, for information on location and also to show the scale of the park.  

 

#### Back to top Buttons  

This is an extra feature, enabling the user to be able to click to go back to the top of the website instead of having to scroll.  

This Idea was sourced from an online website 

 

### Social Media Links (Footer) 

This includes the icons which take the user to the relevant social media page  

This code was sourced from Code Institute’s Bootstrap CV project 

 

 ## Features  

 

### Current Features  

I have created a website that is fully responsive on all screen sizes eg Tablet Mobile Laptop, by using the Bootsrap grid system. This allows the texts and images to translate properly on these devices.  

 

### Interactive Elements  

I have included a hover function on the gallery tab to enable users to zoom in on the pictures.  

I have also added a Map to the bottom page of the website in order for uses to see the scale of the park and the different car parks/entrances and location.  

 

## Technologies Used  

### Languages used 

* HTML 5 and CSS 3  

### Frameworks and Library Programs 

Bootstrap 5  

I used Bootstrap for the Navigation Bar and Carousel 

 

####  Google Fonts 

Two fonts Ubantu and Monserrat Bold, were imported from google font.  

 

####  Font awesome 

I used the social media icons from font awesome  

 

####  Git  

Git was used as version control in terminal  

 

####  Github 

Github was used to create and store the project repository  

 

####  Gitpod  

Gitpod was used to create my files and where I wrote the code.  

 

* JQuery  

JQuery came with Bootstrap to make the Nav bar responsive  

 

### Testing 

* I have sent the website link to friends and family who have tested the website.  

 

* Bug  

Bug found from the gallery page. Navigation bar button wasn’t working after going on mobile version of the website.  

 

## Deployment  

* GitHub Pages  

Strictly followed my innovative ideas, by searching on google full stack developer websites. (First attempt at this milestone can be viewed here.. Link) where my ideas devolved from.  

 

## Summary 

This website was created as, I noticed when researching ideas for this project, that there was no specific website dedicated to the park. Only the pages on the Birmingham City Council Website were the only information I could find; however, this was just text and no pictures and not overly informative.  

I believe I have a created a website that shows the natural beauty of the park, with stunning visual imagery and links to activities, nature and restaurants.
